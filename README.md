# NJQ
A small JQuery replacement for simple apps running on modern browsers

## Why?
I sometimes write simple web apps that need a simple, fast, and small library to perform simple operations that are often performed using JQuery. Although JQuery is impressive at supporting many different browsers and providing so much functionality, I sometimes need a more straightforward and faster library. NJQ is this library.

## Does it work on this browser?
Probably, but you can check out for yourself by visiting [this page](https://stefanovazzocell.github.io/NJQ/docs/).

## Versions
NJQ follows tentatively [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

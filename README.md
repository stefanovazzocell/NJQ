# NJQ
A small JQuery replacement for simple apps running on modern browsers

## Why?
I sometimes write simple web apps that need a simple, fast, and small library to perform simple operations that are often performed using JQuery. Although JQuery is impressive at supporting many different browsers and providing so much functionality, I sometimes need a more straightforward and faster library. NJQ is this library.

## Does it work on my browser?
Probably, but you can check out for yourself by visiting [this page](https://stefanovazzocell.github.io/NJQ/docs/).

## What version should I choose?
A few versions are provided. Depending on what your needs are, you might prefer some compared to others.
Here's a handy chart:

| File                | ajax* |  size**  |
| ------------------- |:-----:| -------- |
| njq###.min.js       | yes   | 2.6 kB   |
| njq_ajax_###.min.js | no    | 2.5 kB   |

`* if you need any ajax request (ajax(), post(), and get()) use this version`

`** size for the min file, version 0.2.1, not gzipped`

## How do I download it?
You can download this program at the [releases](https://github.com/stefanovazzocell/NJQ/releases/) page on Github.

For the latest updates, features, and fixes you can experiment with the raw development version; just save [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanovazzocell/NJQ/master/src/njq.js) file.

## Versions
NJQ follows tentatively [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

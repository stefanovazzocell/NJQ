# NJQ
A small JQuery replacement for simple apps running on modern browsers

## Why?
I sometime write simple webapps that need a simple, fast, and small library to perform simple operations that are often performed using JQuery. Although JQuery is amazing at supporting many different browsers and provviding so much functionality, I sometime need a simpler and faster library. NJQ is this library.
